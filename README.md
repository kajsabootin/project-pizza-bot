# Pizza Bot

The first pair programming assignment during the Technigo bootcamp. Assignment: Build a Pizza Bot.

## The problem

We did one iteration at a time and decided to clean up the code later on with e.g. functions. We decided to create a for loop to iterate over the pizzas on the menu, to make it more dynamic.

If we had more time, we would have added some kind of validation to the quantity input, and styling to the page in general.
